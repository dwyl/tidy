# Why? 🤷‍♀️

Our house is untidy. 
There is clutter 
(`objects` that don't belong 
in a particular room/surface) 
_everywhere_. 
It's both mentally and physically _exhausting_
and deeply negative
to both adults 
and _especially_ children. 😢

We need to resolve this as our _highest_ priority
because it affects us every day.

## How _Many_ People Are Affected? 💭

If you are lucky enough 
to have grown up 
in a home 
where **_everything_ has a place**
and is **always _perfectly_ tidy**,
count yourself _exceptionally_ lucky!
You lived in a magazine shoot

This is _not_ the "norm";
**_most_ `people`** 
have some degree of clutter
in their homes. 
For the simple reason that 
**_most_ `people`** in a consumer society 
continue buying stuff
and don't have infinite shelf/wardrobe/cupboard space ...
it's _physics_! 

Many `people` have this problem ...

Plenty more examples:

Just looking at these images triggers anxiety for me ... 😬 <br />
If you feel the same way, read on! 

[Marie Kondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo)
wouldn't _need_ 
to write 
"_The **Life Changing Magic** of **Tidying Up**_" - 
the NYT Bestseller that has **sold** more than 
[**9 Million Copies**](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/256#issuecomment-1742853750) -
if this wasn't a _widespread_ issue.

## Hoarders? 🙈

At the extreme, 
accumulation of `objects` cluttering 
people's homes is called 
[hoarding disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_disorder).
It is estimated that around **2% – 6%** of the population 
suffers from it:
[iocdf.org/about-hoarding/who-gets-hoarding-disorder](https://hoarding.iocdf.org/about-hoarding/who-gets-hoarding-disorder/)
If these estimates are correct it's tens of millions of `people`.

If we can build a _simple_ App 
that can help both the hoarders
and their 
[long-suffering family](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37077012),
we can 
**_significantly_ improve millions of people's lives**.

# What? ✨

A micro app with a **_simple_ goal**: 
help you **declutter, tidy & organize** 
your **_physical_ environment**
so you can start living your "***best life***".


# When? ⏳

We want to build this mini app 
so we can _use_ it internally `ASAP`.

# Who? 👥

For now, `tiny` is used 
by the `people` living/working
[`@home`](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/256).

But if we can refine the features/functionality,
we will encourage others to use it.


# How? 💻

Try it: 



## Run it ⬇️

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/tidy.git && cd tidy
```

2. Install the dependencies and create the database:

```sh
source .env_sample
mix setup
```

3. Run the app:

```sh
mix s
```

Visit 
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) 
from your browser,
you should see something similar to:


# TODO: add screenshot!


## Build It! 👷‍♀️

### More Features? 🔔

Please note that our goal with `tidy`
is _not_ to have _all_ the features; 
again, it's _deliberately_  simple.<br />
We will be adding _lots_ more features
to the _full_
[**App**](https://github.com/dwyl/app). <br />
If you have feature ideas, that's great! 🎉 <br />
Please _share_ them: 
[**app/issues**](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues)




<sup>1</sup>**`Tidy`** is our
[**Working title**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) 
for this mini App
so we can discuss it internally. 💡👩‍💻<br />
If you have a name idea/suggestion
that better describes 
what we are building,
please share! 🙏💬
