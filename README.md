# `tidy`<sup>1</sup>

‚ú® a mini app anyone can use to organize their real-world life üéâ

</div>

# Why?

Our house is untidy. 
There is clutter 
(`objects` that don't belong in a particular room/surface) 
_everywhere_. 
It's _exhausting_. 
And it's deeply negative.


## _Many_ People Have this Problem

# What?

A micro app with a _single_ goal: 
help you declutter, tidy & organize your physical environment
thus unlocking your "best life".


# When?

We want to build this mini app 
so we can _use_ it internally `ASAP`.


# Who?

For now, `tiny` is exclusively for use 
by the `people` living/working
[`@home`](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/256).

But if we can refine the features/functionality,
we will encourage others to use it.

## Market?

If you come from a home where everything has a place
and is always perfectly tidy,
count yourself _exceptionally_ lucky!
This is _not_ the "norm".
If it was, 

[Marie Kondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo)
wouldn't have _needed_ 
to write an NYT Bestseller
"_The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up_"
which has sold more than 
[**9 Million Copies**](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/256#issuecomment-1742853750). 

# How?

Try it: 


## Run it



## Build It!





<sup>1</sup>**`Tidy`** is our
[**Working title**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) 
for this mini App
so we can discuss it internally. 
If you have a name idea/suggestion
that better describes 
what we are building,
